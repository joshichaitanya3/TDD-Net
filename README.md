# Topological Defect Finder
Convolutional Neural Network for topological defects classification


The goal of this project is to identify the locations of topological defects in 
an active nematic liquid crystal using deep object detection models. 

Topological defects are a distinctive characteristic of liquid crystals. In 2D active nematics, topological defects are motile, and thus play a profound role in determining the dynamics and steady states of the system. Hence, active nematics promise to be a very good model system for applications such as self-pumping fluids. 

Here is an example of a video of an active nematic, with the defects 
identified using conventional methods after post-processing.

Knowing the precise positions of the defects is crucial to study their kinematic and statistical properties. Moreover, optimal control needs the position of defects in real time to use it in the feedback mechanism.

This is why we aim to achieve faster, potentially real time defect detection using deep learning.
